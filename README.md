#### Selenium
A simple application of this tool is used for getting a gallon bottle reviews of a seller from amazon webpage and the data gotten was made into a dataframe for easy usage. Biggest advantage of this over BeautifulSoup is the fact that I can use a application called ChromeDriver, which allows the algorithm to move to the next page without me manually doing it myself. However, a drawback to it is that I have to download the specific version of my chrome browser.
